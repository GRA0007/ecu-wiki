title: Latch
---

The latch is a recurring object that can be seen on the hatch of all [[drill ships]] that appear within Solar and Sundry. It is notable that the latch also appears on the inside of the ship hatch as shown on [[Solar and Sundry Page 5|page 5]].

## Appearance

The latch is always drawn as a quarter circle segment cutout on the hatch, typically shaded red, with the handle of the latch pointed up, and instructions including an arrow depicted above the latch indicating that turning the handle clockwise will open the hatch. Note that because the latch handle likely is linked to the one on the inside of the door, it must be turned anti-clockwise to open from inside the vessel.

## History

The latch first appears on [[Solar and Sundry Page 2|page 2]] on [[Ezra|Ezra's ship]], and is clearly visible in 3 separate panels.

It shows up again on [[Solar and Sundry Page 5|page 5]], clearly from the inside of [[Tracy|Tracy's ship]] on panel 7, and then drawn too small to properly distinguish in panel 8 from the outside.

### Latch Tease

- On [[Solar and Sundry Page 6|page 6]], it is widely understood that the latch would be visible in panel 1, had it not been for the speech bubble drawn on top.
- On [[Solar and Sundry Page 8|page 8]], we can just see the outline of the latch on [[John|John's ship]], but the detail does not include the handle.

### Fan Following

The latch has a devoted following within the [[Ewan Breakey Fan Club]], known as the Latch Batch (named by [[Ewan Breakey]]).
