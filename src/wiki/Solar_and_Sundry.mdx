Solar and Sundry is a short webcomic written by [[Ewan Breakey]] between 5th March and 10th December in 2023. It only has 10 pages, and was left on a cliffhanger as the comic is unfinished. The website describes it as "a sci-fi horror webcomic about life blooming against all odds"[^homepage].

## Plot

The comic starts with a drill ship that has landed on The Moon of X-54, and the pilot Ezra immediately receives a distress call from another ship that has "crashed through the ground into a cavern"[^page-3]. Ezra then sets out to find the second ship. They discover it has landed near a overground structure that closely resembles a large termite mound, although it appears the size of a human city.

Meanwhile, the pilot of the second ship Tracy searches for a match to light a candle, which they then take outside the ship to explore the cave system they've landed in. After searching for a column that they might be able to shimmy up, Tracy hears a loud sound from behind. They start running, but trip and break their helmet on a rock. They see two human-sized termite creatures approaching. Above ground, Ezra loses Tracy's signal.

Ezra then radios a third character on the moon, Hugo, who appears to have set up a tent with tools and equipment after landing. Hugo mentions a fourth character John, who has not yet landed on the moon, and will have Hand Drills, that may be helpful to find Tracy. Hugo suggests they meet at John's landing site.

Tracy wakes up on a boat in a subterranean sea, accompanied by a human-sized termite who is rowing with two of their arms. They speak a strange language that Tracy interprets as a threat, and then they notice that the boat is on a course to go deep into the moon.

The art style of Solar and Sundry changes dramatically between each page, as it correlates to [[Ewan Breakey]] trying different styles and mediums. The [[Solar and Sundry Page 1|first]] and [[Solar and Sundry Page 2|second]] pages were drawn on a dot-grid paper notebook with pencil, then scanned and digitally coloured. Pages [[Solar and Sundry Page 3|three]], [[Solar and Sundry Page 4|four]] and [[Solar and Sundry Page 5|five]] use the same technique, but were drawn on blank paper instead of dot-grid.

Pages [[Solar and Sundry Page 6|six]], [[Solar and Sundry Page 7|seven]] and [[Solar and Sundry Page 8|eight]] were all drawn and coloured digitally using Procreate[^procreate]. Finally, pages [[Solar and Sundry Page 9|nine]] and [[Solar and Sundry Page 10|ten]] of chapter 2 were drawn digitally but only coloured in grayscale.
